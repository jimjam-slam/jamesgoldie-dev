Nations are slowly but surely moving to cleaner sources of electricity.

After taking a first pass at this map in late 2021 with data from the [International Renewable Energy Agency](https://www.irena.org), we updated this with new data for 2021, a new mapping technical stack and new sharing tools, using lessons learned from the [arms trade map](/career/portfolio/2022-arms-trade).

We released it in time for COP27, when the conversation was on holding nations to account for the transition to Net Zero.
