This map shows future climate projections of very hot days for postcodes across Australia. The projections are courtesy of the [NARCliM1.5](https://doi.org/10.1029/2020EF001833) project.

As part of this map's development, I also wrote a [reproducible pipeline](https://github.com/360-info/climate-projections-narclim15) to retrieve and process the raw, gridded daily projections and to project area averages for any specified [ABS boundaries](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files).

The data underpinning the map was used by News Ltd's David Mills for a story on the impact of extreme heat on workers. I also [wrote a story](https://360info.org/extreme-heat-will-put-more-pressure-on-workers/), published with 360info, with expanded quotes from researchers.
