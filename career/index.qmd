Right now I'm working at [360info](https://newshub.360info.org) as the Data and Digital Storytelling Lead, building the data visualisation and analysis capability of a new, open newswire supported by Monash University.

Here are some of the more ambitious interactives I've produced:

I also produce static charts and infographics, train our interns in data storytelling, work with our media partners to help them use our interactives and datasets, and manage our [GitHub presence](https://github.ciom/360-info), working to make our data and graphics more discoverable.

Although I work in data journalism, I have a background researching the public health impacts of climate change. [Here's my published research.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Otq-xj0AAAAJ&hl=en)

I sometimes give talks on data visualisation, storytelling, open data science and climate change:

Have ideas about communicating climate change or other big ideas better? [I'm always happy to talk!](mailto:me@jamesgoldie.dev)
