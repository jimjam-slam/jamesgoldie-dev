Right now I'm working at [360info](https://newshub.360info.org) as the Data and Digital Storytelling Lead, building the data visualisation and analysis capability of a new media startup hosted by Monash University.

I sometimes give talks on data visualisation, storytelling, open data science and climate change:

I also have a background researching the public health impacts of climate change: I graduated in 2019 with a PhD from the Climate Change Research Centre at UNSW. I investigated extreme heat: how it affects hospital admissions in Australian cities, how it might change with the climate, and what that means for the future of our health system. [Here's my published research.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Otq-xj0AAAAJ&hl=en)

All this means I have a pretty varied mix of skills! I've been doing data science since 2013, and you can see [tools and websites I've built](/projects) that run the gamut from data analysis packages like collateral, through to sophisticated data visualisation platforms like [climdex.org](https://climdex.org) website.

Have ideas about communicating climate change or other big ideas better? [I'm always happy to talk!](mailto:me@jamesgoldie.dev)
