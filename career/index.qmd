Right now I'm working at [360info](https://newshub.360info.org) as the Data and Digital Storytelling Lead, building the data visualisation and analysis capability of an open newswire supported by Monash University.

Here are some of the more ambitious interactives I've produced:

I also occasionally write, commission and edit stories alongside our other editors. Here're some of the stories I've been involved in:

- [Inflation pushes student debts up despite repayments](https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/05/10/inflation-pushes-student-help-debts-up-despite-repayments/) Written May 2024
- [How dangerous is extreme heat to humans](https://360info.org/how-dangerous-is-extreme-heat-to-humans/) (Commissioned August 2023)
- [Renters in older homes feeling the heat ](https://360info.org/renters-in-older-homes-feeling-the-heat/) (Written March 2023)
- [Extreme heat will put more pressure on workers](https://360info.org/extreme-heat-will-put-more-pressure-on-workers/) (Written February 2023)
- [The ecological crisis in the Arctic Ocean](https://360info.org/the-ecological-crisis-in-the-arctic-ocean/) (Comissioned October 2022)
- [Seeing emotions just the start for brain-reading technology](https://360info.org/seeing-emotions-just-the-start-for-brain-reading-technology/) (Comissioned September 2022)

Beyond building our big interactives, I:

- produce static charts and infographics
- train our staff in data storytelling
- work with our media partners to help them use our interactives and datasets
- work with our infrastructure providers to test updates and plan work
- manage our [GitHub presence](https://github.ciom/360-info) and the [360 Visuals](https://360info.org/visuals) site

Although I work in data journalism, I have a research background in the public health impacts of climate change, including a PhD from [UNSW Sydney](https://unsw.edu.au). [Here's my published research.](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Otq-xj0AAAAJ&hl=en)

Have ideas about communicating climate change or other big ideas better? I'm always happy to talk!
