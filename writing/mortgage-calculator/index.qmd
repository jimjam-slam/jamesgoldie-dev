# What kind of house can I buy with my saved deposit?

<!-- inputs:
- money saved
- deposit fraction: 5%? 10%? 15%? 20%? Higher?
- stamp duty? https://www.sro.vic.gov.au/calculators/land-transfer-calculator
  - first home exemption/concession? https://www.sro.vic.gov.au/fhbduty
  - off-the-plan first home concession? https://www.sro.vic.gov.au/offtheplan
    - off the plan might be too complicated!
- lmi
  - might need to estimate!
  - lmi premium loadings?
-->

<!--
maybe easier if house_price is the independent var?

(house_price * deposit_rate) + lmi + stamp_duty + other_transaction_costs = money_saved
(house_price * deposit_rate) + lmi + stamp_duty + other_transaction_costs + money_borrowed = house_price

viewof money_saved = Inputs.range([0, 5E+6], {
  value: 6e+5,
  step: 1e+3,
  transform: Math.log,

viewof deposit_frac = Inputs.range([0.01, 0.99], {
