I'm James, a data journalist, researcher and software engineer.

I have a broad set of skills around analysing, visualising and communicating data. In the last few years I've [used those skills](/career/) to help Australians understand climate change and make journalistic graphics free and open.

I can use those skills to [help you too!](/services/) Whether you need a consultant to build dashboards and websites, or you're looking to train your team in data analysis and visualisation, I'm your guy.

Or maybe you're looking for my [other projects](/projects). Open source data tools, fun and useful websites, or other wild things I've built—they're all here.
