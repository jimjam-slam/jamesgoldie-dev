# Workshops

I regularly run workshops designed to help beginners get comfortable with data. 

You don't need to be data science experts to benefit from my training! Attendees could be:

- **New researchers or students** who are working with data for the first time
- **Journalists** who haven't worked with data before but are ready to expand their skills
- **Analysts or policy researchers** who are comfortable with Excel or Google Sheets but are ready to take the next step with coding

My data science workshops are run in a disposable cloud environment that **attendees can access with just a link**, so we can skip the setup issues and make the most of your time.

Jamesâ€™ data visual workshops provided immensely invaluable tools, resources, and expert guidance for early career researchers in our centre. It is a workshop that all STEM researchers should take.

Workshops I can run for your team range can be as short as 3-hour "taster" workshops that give attendees awareness and skills for future practice, through to full-day or multi-day workshops designed to give attendees a full set of data storytelling skills.

- **Why code? Saving time with data**
- **Data science fundamentals: collecting, wrangling and visualising data**

For students and researchers:

- **Designing graphics for journal publication**
- **Designing graphics for outreach**

For journalists:

- **Basics of finding and getting data from the web**
- **Advanced scraping from adversarial sources**

If those topics aren't quite what you're looking for, get in touch and we can develop a workshop that fits your needs!

# Consulting

I'm also happy to help you and your team directly, whether it's building impactful data-driven visuals for an upcoming report or simply helping you strategise.

[As a data journalist](/career), I've built accessible, interactive visuals from complex data for years. If you're excited by the possibilities of embracing data storytelling but aren't sure where to start, email me!
