_**Note:** this project has now been retired._

I produced two websites for the recent ARCCSS Showcase. One of those was _The Heartbeat of Australian Extremes_. Although Australia experiences heat extremes regularly, they are getting worse. This site shows the annual trend in hot nights (> 20 Â°C) each year next to an animated map of hot nights.

I've written about [some of the design decisions](http://climateextremes.org.au/arccss-showcase-projects/) behind this project, as well as [some of the technical challenges](https://medium.com/@jamesgoldie/challenges-visualising-climate-extremes-with-leaflet-7a407162d75f).
