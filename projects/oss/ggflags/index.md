I've taken over development of ggflags, an extension to ggplot2 that allows you to plot country flags as points or bubbles. The original was developed by  [Baptiste's Augui√©](https://github.com/baptiste/ggflags), and I've so far extended it to use round, vector flags from the [EmojiOne v2](https://www.emojione.com/) set (so they'll look great at any size).

If you're having a problem with the package or would like to contribute to its development and maintenance, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/rensa/ggflags/issues) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/rensa/ggflags/pulls)!
