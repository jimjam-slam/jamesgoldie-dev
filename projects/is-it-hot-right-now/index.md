Sometimes you just need a simple answer to a (not-so-)simple question: is it hot right wow?

Mat Lipson, Steefan Contractor and I cobbled the basic concept for this over a few weekends in late 2017. Since our first proof of concept with the Sydney Observatory Hill weather station, we've expanded to 9 locations nationally, analysing decades of historical weather data to tell you whether it's unusually hot today.

Is It Hot Right Now still regularly receives spikes of traffic and interest on social media during heatwaves and other extreme heat events.
