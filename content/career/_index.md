<span style="font-size:1.5rem;">I'm a researcher and data scientist with a focus on visualising and communicating climate change.</span>

Right now I'm working at the [Monash Climate Change Communication Hub](https://monash.edu/mcccrh) as a Senior Knowledge Broker, helping to bridge the gap between climate scientists and the media! But I also have a background researching the public health impacts of climate change: I graduated in 2019 with a PhD from the Climate Change Research Centre at UNSW.

All this means I have a pretty varied mix of skills! I've been doing data science since 2013, and you can see [tools and websites I've built](/projects) that run the gamut from data analysis packages like collateral, through to sophisticated data viusalisation platforms like the Climdex website.
