description: Track the time you waste with Centrelink.

Since I spent a long, long, _long_ time on hold with Centrelink as a student, I developed a tracker to help you log your interactions while receiving welfare payments. I also [expressed some strong opinions](https://medium.com/@jamesgoldie/welfare-is-a-waste-of-time-485d38c9c6a7) about the usefulness of having to do this.
