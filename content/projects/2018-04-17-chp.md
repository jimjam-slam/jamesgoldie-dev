The [Climate Health Network](https://climatehealth.info) is a collaboration between the Faculty of Science and Faculty of Health at UNSW. We are an interdisciplinary team of scientists who have formed a partnership to investigate the relationships between climate change and human health.

I developed the website for the Climate Health Network's precursor (the Climate Health Partnership) and advised on the design of the new website with [Donna Green](https://donnagreen.org/) of the [Climate Change Research Centre](http://ccrc.unsw.edu.au).
